The blockchain is a public ledger that records bitcoin transactions
A novel solution accomplishes this without any trusted central authority:
the maintenance of the blockchain is performed by a network of communicating
nodes running bitcoin software Transactions of the form payer X sends
Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this network using readily available
software applications Network nodes can validate transactions add them
to their copy of the ledger and then broadcast these ledger additions to
other nodes The blockchain is a distributed database â€“ to achieve
independent verification of the chain of ownership of any and every bitcoin
amount each network node stores its own copy of the
blockchain Approximately six times per hour a new group of accepted
transactions a block is created added to the blockchain and quickly
published to all nodes This allows bitcoin software to determine when a
particular bitcoin amount has been spent which is necessary in order to
prevent double-spending in an environment without central oversight Whereas a
conventional ledger records the transfers of actual bills or promissory notes
that exist apart from it the blockchain is the only place that bitcoins can
be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions 5
Transactions
Number of bitcoin transactions per month (logarithmic scale)
See also: Bitcoin network
Transactions are defined using a Forth-like scripting language 5
Transactions consist of one or more inputs and one or more outputs When a
user sends bitcoins the user designates each address and the amount of bitcoin
being sent to that address in an output To prevent double spending each input
must refer to a previous unspent output in the blockchain The use of
multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash
transaction Since transactions can have multiple outputs users can send
bitcoins to multiple recipients in one transaction As in a cash transaction
the sum of inputs (coins used to pay)
can exceed the intended sum of payments In such a case an additional output
is used returning the change back to the payer Any input satoshis
not accounted for in the transaction outputs become the transaction fee
Transaction fees
An actual bitcoin transaction including the fee from a webbased cryptocurrency
exchange to a hardware wallet
Paying a transaction fee is optional Miners can choose which transactions
to process and they are incentivised to prioritize those that pay
higher fees
Because the size of mined blocks is capped by the network miners choose
transactions based on the fee paid relative to their storage size not
the absolute amount of money paid as a fee Thus fees are generally measured
in satoshis per byte or sat/b The size of transactions is dependent on
the number of inputs used to create the transaction and the number of
outputs 8
Ownership
Simplified chain of ownership In reality a transaction can have more than
one input and more than one output
In the blockchain bitcoins are registered to bitcoin addresses Creating
a bitcoin address is nothing more than picking a random valid private key
and computing the corresponding bitcoin address This computation can be
done in a split second But the reverse (computing the private key of a
given bitcoin address) is mathematically unfeasible and so users can tell
others and make public a bitcoin address without compromising its
corresponding private key Moreover the number of valid private keys is so
vast that it is extremely unlikely someone will compute a key-pair that is
already in use and has funds The vast number of valid private keys makes it
unfeasible that brute force could be used for that To be able
to spend the bitcoins the owner must know the corresponding private key and
digitally sign the transaction The network verifies the signature using the
public key 5
If the private key is lost the bitcoin network will not recognize any other
evidence of ownership the coins are then unusable and effectively lost
For example in 2013 one user claimed to have lost 7500 bitcoins worth $75
million at the time when he accidentally discarded a hard drive containing
his private key A backup of his key(s)
